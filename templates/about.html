				<h2>1. How it started</h2>
				All of this started in April 2017. I have joined a group studying cs231n course. This is an amazing course about deep learning. I wasn't going to do a final project, but with time I realized that I want to do at least something at the end of it. In several weeks I have incidentally found a site where people could draw a digit and then some model would perform image recognition and immediately show prediction. Thaw was interesting! Building a model and showing prediction accuracy in Jupyter Notebook is okay, but if anyone can draw some digit and receive a prediction is an instant - this is much more impressive. 
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5"><h2>2. Motivation</h2>
				So I wanted to do something similar. But doing exactly the same wouldn't be satisfying. Something new was necessary. Firstly, I decided to collect training data by myself. MNIST dataset could be used, but there are so many models trained on it...
			</div>-->
	 
			<div class="col-md-4"><h2>1. Motivation</h2>
				After completing cs231n course (with a study group) I wanted to do something like a final project, but with interactivity, so that anyone could use it. Also I hoped to acquire or hone some practical skills on the way. So it was decided to try a simple project with a number of condition. It would be digit recognition (a classi—Å problem), but training data should be collected by myself (as using MNIST or CIFAR or some other data set won't be as interesting) and this should work online and be interactive - this means building a site. Additionally I thought that it would be cool, if model's performance could change and improve based on the input.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4"><h2>2. First plans</h2>
				The initial step of doing a project is creating a plan. First of all it was necessary to collect the data. The best way to do it is to create a draft version of the site with minimal functionality and possibility to draw and save digit. But how many digits are necessary? Neural nets usually require a lot of data. A solution lies in data augmentation technics which can increase the volume data manifold. Then a model should be trained on the data and be able to be trained on additional data. This model should be able to generate predictions and show them on site. This is a general outline.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4"><h2>3. Basic site</h2>
				There are several popular frameworks for Web development in Python, I was familiar only with Flask and decided to try it. It turned out to be quite easy to set up a basic site. Making a canvas for drawing turned out to be more challenging. In the end I have found a code on Github which was simple enough and it worked after some modifications. So the site had only canvas, radio buttons to select the digit and buttons to save the digit and to clear the canvas. Now the question was: where should the digits be saved. A good idea would be to save them online, but Heroku doesn't allow saving new files (only temporarily) and I decided to upload images to Amazon.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4"><h2>4. Collecting data</h2>
				It turned out that there are good packages for Amazon, which make things quite simple (namly boto and boto3). I was able to upload and download files from the bucket, it took more time to integrate this into the site, so that drawn images would be uploaded to the cloud. It took me several days to draw 1000 images. Then I studied images on MNIST dataset and decided to do the following augmentations: resize the image so that its width and height are increased/decreased and turning the image by certain angles. This results in 24 images for each original image.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4"><h2>5. Feed forward net</h2>
				I dediced to try simple feed forward neural net at first (as opposed to CNN). After trials and errors I decided that two-layered net would be enough. Hidden layer has 100 neurons and ReLu activation, output layer has sigmoid activation. Starting learning rate is 0.1 and after each epoch decays with a ratio of 0.95. The next step after creating the net itself was preparing it for online training, so that weights could be updated for the new images. I used the same structure, but removed learning rate decay. You can read more about the model on the relevant <a href="#">page</a>.
